This is to play with procedurally rendering things using python. Mostly as an excuse to use math :p

# Specifics
## FileAnimate
This renders files into pngs and mp4s.

## MinecraftAnimate
This renders frames into Minecraft. [Here is a similar project I did a while ago that used videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOspgfu_BaU). This version is to move to 3d rendering.

## Useage
Give a class with a `step()` function that returns a frame.
